Welcome to the MSU DIT Pre-Deployment User Transfer script. This script is designed to pre-load a user's data onto their new machine. This can either be done from Mac -> Mac, or using a host machine and transferring from a external HDD to the new device. In this script, the technician is meant to select the source directory and destination directory, as well as select whether or not to include the standard user Library files (as pictured below)
